<h1>FIRST LANDING</h1>

<p>Welcome to a World of Adventure, Text-Based Game in Ruby!</p>
<p>How has this game been made ? Glad you asked...No surprise there. By magic, obviously. You can't orchestrate these things. Soon you'll find that in the world of Ruby, magic is an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>...Now we're going to enter hard mode...It might sound a bit morbid, but that's just the life-and-death World of Adventure.</p>
<p>OUR NAMES DON'T MATTER, NEITHER DOES YOUR...AND STRANGE AS IT SEEMS WE'RE HERE TO HELP!</p>
<p>Fasten your seatbelts and check out <a href="/about" title="">The Case of the Unexplained</a></p>
