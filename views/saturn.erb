  <p>Welcome to Saturn.</p>
  <p>Saturn has large rings orbiting it, so large, that they were able to be observed by Gailelo using a telescope in 1610</p>
  <p>The rings of Saturn are made of water ice particles; there are 8 main groups of rings.</p>
  <p>The rings have started to melt due to the intense heat generated by stars which have expanded into red giants in their lifecycle/</p>
  <p>Your mission is to save the rings from melting by releasing icing liquid from the spacecraft<p>
  <p>This is not for the faint-hearted.  What do you decide to do?</p>

  <p>You made a heroic choice and will be remembered in history books.</p>
  <p>You orbit the planet along the rings in your spacecraft.</p>
  <p>Saturn has 62 moons though, and these moons also launch waves along the rings, you must watch they don't hit you.</p>
  <p>You ride the rings of Saturn, and the moons are coming at you. Do you attempt to hit them off?</p>

<p>It's too late.  You tried to escape, but the moons smash your spacecraft to smithereens. It is karma for running away!</p>
